# Programming Paradigm Projects – Python (ALX)

This repository contains several Python projects focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), error handling, unit testing, and command-line interaction. Each task builds essential skills for writing clean, structured, and testable Python code.

## 📌 **Project 0: Simple Bank Account Class**

### **Objective**
Learn basic OOP concepts by creating a `BankAccount` class and interacting with it through command-line arguments.

### **Files**
- `bank_account.py`
- `main-0.py`

### **Features**
- Create a bank account with a starting balance.
- Deposit money.
- Withdraw money with balance validation.
- Display the current balance.
- CLI usage such as:

## 📌 **Project 1: Robust Division Calculator**

### **Objective**
Practice error handling using try/except blocks when dividing numbers from command-line arguments.

### **Files**
- `robust_division_calculator.py`
- `main.py` (for this project)

### **Features**
- Function `safe_divide(numerator, denominator)` that:
- Converts inputs to floats.
- Handles non-numeric inputs.
- Prevents division by zero.
- CLI example:

## 📌 **Project 2: Unit Tests for SimpleCalculator**

### **Objective**
Learn how to write unit tests using Python’s `unittest` module.

### **Files**
- `simple_calculator.py` (provided)
- `test_simple_calculator.py` (your task)

### **Features**
- Tests written for:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (including division by zero)
- Run tests with:

## 📌 **Project 3: Library Management System (Basic OOP)**

### **Objective**
Strengthen OOP by modeling books and a library using classes, attributes, and methods.

### **Files**
- `library_management.py`
- `main_library.py` (or similar testing script)

### **Features**
### **Book Class**
- Public attributes: `title`, `author`
- Private attribute: `_is_checked_out`
- Methods to check out, return, and check availability

### **Library Class**
- Stores multiple books
- Add books
- Check out a book by title
- Return a book
- List available books

### **Sample Expected Output**

## 🧪 **Skills Gained**
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, attributes, methods)
- Encapsulation and private attributes
- Command-line argument parsing (`sys.argv`)
- Error handling with try/except
- Writing and running unit tests
- Code organization across multiple scripts
