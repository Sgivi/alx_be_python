This readme contains Python tasks from the ALX Backend Python program:
an arithmetic operations function and a simple shopping list manager.

## 1. Arithmetic Operations (`arithmetic_operations.py`)

Implements `perform_operation(num1, num2, operation)` which supports:

* `add`
* `subtract`
* `multiply`
* `divide` (handles division by zero)

**Error messages:**

* `"Error: Division by zero"`
* `"Error: Invalid operation"`

Test using the provided `main.py`.

## 2. Shopping List Manager (`shopping_list_manager.py`)

A menu-driven CLI program that lets the user:

* Add an item
* Remove an item
* View the current list
* Exit the program

Uses a Python list to store and update shopping items.
