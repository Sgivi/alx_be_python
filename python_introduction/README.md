My ALX Back-End Python projects and exercises.

1. Basic Arithmetic Exercise

What I Learned

How to create variables in Python to store numbers.

How to perform simple calculations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

How to display variables together with text using the print() function.

Challenges I Faced

I initially found using the terminal confusing, so I ended up using the VS Code terminal to run my code.

Summary
This exercise helped me understand how to combine text and numbers in Python output and practice basic arithmetic operations in a program.


2. Simple Interest Calculator

What I Learned

How to calculate simple interest using Python arithmetic operations.

How to store values in variables and use a mathematical formula in code.

How to print results clearly using the print() function.

Challenges I Faced

This task was straightforward because the formula and instructions were provided.

Summary
In this exercise, I calculated the simple interest for a principal of 1000 at a 5% rate over 3 years using Python. It helped me practice variable assignments and arithmetic operations.


3. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

What I Learned

How to calculate the area of a rectangle using Python.

How to assign values to variables and perform multiplication.

How to display the result using the print() function.

Challenges I Faced

The exercise was straightforward and helped me clearly follow each instruction.

Summary
In this task, I calculated the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. This helped me practice variable assignments and arithmetic operations in Python.


4. Exercise: Converting Hours to Seconds

What I learned: How to store values in variables and use arithmetic to perform unit conversions.
What I did: I calculated how many seconds are in 2 hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds, I multiplied hours * 3600.
Result: 2 hours = 7200 seconds.
Reflection: This helped me understand how Python handles numbers and prints text mixed with variables.


5. User Input Age Calculator

What I Learned

How to prompt a user to input a value using input().

How to convert user input from a string to an integer with int().

How to perform arithmetic operations on user-provided data.

Challenges I Faced

The exercise was straightforward, but I had to make sure to use the correct variable when printing the result.

Summary
This code calculates the user’s age in the year 2050 by adding 27 years to their current age. It helped me practice handling user input, converting types, and combining variables with text in Python output
